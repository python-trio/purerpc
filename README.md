_purerpc_ is a native, async Python gRPC client and server implementation supporting
[asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html),
[uvloop](https://github.com/MagicStack/uvloop), and
[trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio) (achieved with [anyio](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio) compatibility layer).

This project is in maintenance mode.  Updates will primarily be limited to fixing
severe bugs, keeping the package usable for actively developed projects, and
easing maintenance.

For use cases limited to asyncio, consider the Python package published by the
main [grpc](https://github.com/grpc/grpc) project instead.

## Requirements

* CPython >= 3.7
* PyPy >= 3.7

## Installation

Latest PyPI version:

```bash
pip install purerpc[grpc]
```

NOTE: for PyPy, replace "grpc" with "grpc-pypy".  Support is tentative, as
  [grpc does not officially support PyPy](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/issues/4221).

Latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/python-trio/purerpc.git[grpc]
```

These invocations will include dependencies for the grpc runtime and
generation of service stubs.

To install extra dependencies for running tests or examples, using the
`test_utils` module, etc., apply the `[dev]` suffix (e.g.
`pip install purerpc[dev]`).

## protoc plugin

purerpc adds `protoc-gen-purerpc` plugin for `protoc` to your `PATH` environment variable
so you can use it to generate service definition and stubs: 

```bash
protoc --purerpc_out=. --python_out=. -I. greeter.proto
```

or, if you installed the `grpcio-tools` Python package:

```bash
python -m grpc_tools.protoc --purerpc_out=. --python_out=. -I. greeter.proto
```

## Usage

NOTE: `greeter_grpc` module is generated by purerpc's `protoc-gen-purerpc` plugin.

### Server

```python
from purerpc import Server
from greeter_pb2 import HelloRequest, HelloReply
from greeter_grpc import GreeterServicer


class Greeter(GreeterServicer):
    async def SayHello(self, message):
        return HelloReply(message="Hello, " + message.name)

    async def SayHelloToMany(self, input_messages):
        async for message in input_messages:
            yield HelloReply(message=f"Hello, {message.name}")


if __name__ == '__main__':
    server = Server(50055)
    server.add_service(Greeter().service)
    # NOTE: if you already have an async loop running, use "await server.serve_async()"
    import anyio
    anyio.run(server.serve_async)  # or set explicit backend="asyncio" or "trio"
```

### Client

```python
import purerpc
from greeter_pb2 import HelloRequest, HelloReply
from greeter_grpc import GreeterStub


async def gen():
    for i in range(5):
        yield HelloRequest(name=str(i))


async def listen():
    async with purerpc.insecure_channel("localhost", 50055) as channel:
        stub = GreeterStub(channel)
        reply = await stub.SayHello(HelloRequest(name="World"))
        print(reply.message)

        async for reply in stub.SayHelloToMany(gen()):
            print(reply.message)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # NOTE: if you already have an async loop running, use "await listen()"
    import anyio
    anyio.run(listen)  # or set explicit backend="asyncio" or "trio"
```

You can mix server and client code, for example make a server that requests something using purerpc from another gRPC server, etc.

# Project history

purerpc was originally written by [Andrew Stepanov](https://github.com/standy66)
and used the curio async event loop.  Later it
was migrated to the [anyio](https://github.com/agronholm/anyio) API, supporting
asyncio, curio, uvloop, and trio (though curio support has since been dropped
from the API).

After going a few years unmaintained, the project was adopted by the [python-trio
organization](https://github.com/python-trio) with the intent of ensuring a
continued gRPC solution for Trio users.
